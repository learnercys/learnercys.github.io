                    It’s 2013, at that time I started my first job as software developer; working mostly frontend, backend
                    was already defined and it didn’t require to much work. Also at that time I get my first experience developing
                    with Node and Django. Node started to be a good friend, Angular and a bunch of modules helped me to do my work.
                    My comprehension about software engineering started to grow, someone talked to me about design patterns and why
                    good practices in code is essential. Then, after a while, the application that I was working on started to be big
                    and something told me that my code shouldn’t be increasing that way -something could be improved- a post talked
                    to me about distributing single pages with Node, and that was the answer, decoupling let me thing less about all
                    components behavior but to worry only about the one that I was working with.

                    Years passed and after some time I started to work as full-time developer in an office with small groups of
                    people... and big groups also, it was an amazing time, a lot of things learned, friends and colleges sharing
                    knowledge and amazing stories, lots of errors with incredible solutions.

                    Right now I’m focused in two things; software engineering and mathematics. I’ve been working with software
                    for some time now, and in that time -using many languages, frameworks and libraries- I could understand that
                    every one of these technologies could be represented with some conceptual knowledge that doesn’t belong to one,
                    and because of that, at some point, I started to want to be recognized as a person who can describe platforms
                    without the need to involve any technology before time, and then, when in time, use engineering concepts and designs
                    to describe software.

                    Mathematics, what can’t I say  about mathematics? being the science about abstraction that quite literally could
                    describe any other science patterns and behaviors, how else can we describe weather forecast and make predictions,
                    to model symptoms of diseases and take actions immediately?

                <p>
                    Probability, Physics and Science itself depends on mathematics to demonstrate the true.

Also at that time I get my first experience developing with Node and Django. Node started to be a good friend, Angular and a bunch of modules helped me to do my work. My comprehension about software engineering started to grow, someone talked to me about design patterns and why good practices in code is essential. Then, after a while, the application that I was working on started to be big and something told me that my code shouldn’t be increasing that way -something could be improved- a post talked to me about distributing single pages with Node, and that was the answer, decoupling let me thing less about all components behavior but to worry only about the one that I was working with."),l.default.createElement("p",null,"Years passed and after some time I started to work as full-time developer in an office with small groups of people... and big groups also, it was an amazing time, a lot of things learned, friends and colleges sharing knowledge and amazing stories, lots of errors with incredible solutions."),l.default.createElement("p",null,"Right now I’m focused in two things; software engineering and mathematics.
